1) For the ec2 instances of worker nodes of k8s cluster, we need to give them proper names in the eks cluster terraform file.
2) To destroy only EKS cluster made using the EKS module : 
terraform destroy -target=module.eks

3) To recreate the cluster as it was previous from scratch ; 
terraform apply -target=module.eks

4) For now not adding the TLS issuer in kubernetes folder
